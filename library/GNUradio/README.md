Description: Redhawk III will continue geolocation efforts with miniaturized antennas that can be placed on an aerial or ground unmanned platform. Cadets will incorporate smaller form factor computers, such as the Raspberry PI or Beagle Bone, into the new mobile RF collection devices. Software development for the RF collection will continue using the Redhawk Software Defined Radio Framework. EE cadets will develop a platform that extends beyond pseudo-Doppler with directional antennas. CS cadets will expand on the algorithm that goes from a static perspective of the RF Landscape into one that can handle the new mobile RF collection platforms.
